## Data
Our dataset contains ~31K examples of complex natural language responses in the **weather** domain and ~51k in **E2E** challenge. Each response was collected by providing annotators with a *user query*, a *compositional meaning representation* (with discourse relations and dialog acts), and a *context*. Currently *context* is not provided yet but we will release soon. All of these are made available in our dataset. See our linked paper for more details. 


#### We are currently preparing code for release, and plan to add them to this repository as soon as possible. Stay tuned for updates!
